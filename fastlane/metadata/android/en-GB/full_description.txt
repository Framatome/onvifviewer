Use this open-source app to view your network cameras using the ONVIF protocol.

The development of this app was started as part of the ONVIF Spotlight Challange.

You can connect to your network camera and view the video of it. If the camera is controllable you can move it as well.

NOTE: The video codec of Android doesn't support all types of RTSP streams. Therefore currently the video is not a live stream, but a series of snapshots.
