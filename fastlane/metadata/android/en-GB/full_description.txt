Use this opensource app to view your network cameras using the ONVIF protocol.

The development of this app was started as part of the ONVIF Spotlight Challange [https://onvif-spotlight.bemyapp.com/#/event]. 

NOTE: The video codec of Android doesn't support all types of RTSP streams. Therefore currently the video is not a live stream, but a series of snapshots.

The sources of this app are available at the Gitlab page [https://gitlab.com/caspermeijn/onvifviewer].
